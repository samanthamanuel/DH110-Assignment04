# Assignment 04: Persona + Usage Scenario, Samantha Alexis Manuel, DH110

## Purpose of UX Storytelling 

UX storytelling is important for sharing experiences and explaining the values that users hold. By carefully crafting stories, you can build a better product. Good UX storytelling considers potential conflicts a user may encounter when trying to reach a specific goal and provides a possible solution through your product. Understanding how this process works can help you emotionally connect with your users and the product will be more user-centric/empathic. 

## 2 Tasks Proposed for UX Design 

Based on my previous research, I plan to add 2 design features that I believe will allow users to better navigate a digital cookbook project:

* *Ability to add multiple collaborators to one project*
* *Ability to use a pre-existing template for recipe book page*

## User Scenarios + Journey Maps

### Nayeli’s Scenario (Feature: Adding Multiple Collaborators)

Nayeli is a second year student at UCLA and is, for the time being, living in an apartment with 3 other residents. For most of her life, Nayeli has had the privileged experience of not having to cook for herself. Back in the dorms, she had a meal plan and never worried about having to fend for herself. Now, it is time for her to learn how to cook, but she doesn’t know where to start! She’s intimidated by grocery stores (never had to help her parents with grocery shopping) and ends up shopping for processed or premade frozen foods. For the 1st month, her diet consisted of these types of foods until the 2nd month she noticed some changes in her body. She felt more tired than usual and struggled to get through campus without breaking (a lot) of sweat. She also started feeling homesick again and longed for the taste of her mother’s cooking. Thus, she wants to know how she can ask/learn how to cook her family’s recipes without the constraints of time or location. 

She then came across “With Ingredients that Bind” as recommended by her roommate who was going through the exact same struggle of missing home and wanting a more balanced diet. After creating an account on the app, she created a project/repository for sharing recipes. After doing so, she invited her family members (Mom, Dad, and Younger Brother) as collaborators to  the project via iMessage where she texted, “Hey Fam Bam! How are you guys doing? I miss you lots, but I miss your home cooking even more! Check out this cool app that I just downloaded. If you download it too, we can share recipes. I’ve been craving mom’s Chicken Fajitas— can you upload your recipe here with ingredients, measurements, and steps? If it’s easier, there’s also an option to take a video. I love you!!! Call me whenever you have the time.”

Within hours of sending the invite she got a text back from her mother, “Hi Sweetie, how awesome is this! We miss you too, adulting/cooking is hard huh, no worries, when I come back from work I’ll send you the information you need and videos that I’ll force your dad to record hehe. Love you too.” Several hours after that, her mom uploaded the recipe to the shared project to which now Nayeli had access to! Now she could plan for her dinner tomorrow. Everytime she had a question about the recipe she would message within the app and then either her Mother, Father, or Brother would add comments to answer her questions, sometimes they would leave notes about how much they missed each other. 

This app was heaven sent. Nayeli was able to explore and cook new dishes that kept her healthy and energized. In addition to this, she felt less homesick and more connected with her family despite the distance. Feeling satisfied with the app and her new balanced diet, she was finally able to restore her energy levels while having the stamina to go about her day.

### Alysha’s Scenario (Feature: Pre-existing Template)

Alysha is a chef at one of the hottest Filipino Fusion restaurants in San Diego. When she’s not in the kitchen, you can probably find her at home spending time with her lovely wife and 3 kids. However, recent loss in her family (her dad) has caused her to take a bereavement leave. Now, she is beginning to rethink what it means to preserve family recipes and the memory of her father. While most of the recipes she learned from her parents in the kitchen and now reinterpreted for the restaurant’s menu, she realized that she hasn’t  been able to fully teach her own family recipes to her children. What if she also passed away unexpectedly? Who would pass on these traditions to the next generation?

Alysha started inquiring about her family’s recipes, even calling relatives who live in the Philippines to ask where/how they store their recipes. Disappointed, but not surprised, pretty much all of her relatives gave her a similar response, that they simply measure with their eyes, taste (and heart). They were never thinking about writing down the recipe or thinking about the exact measurements. They only used whatever they had in the kitchen or was available, so whatever wasn’t there they would simply adapt to. 

She was worried that if no one began to preserve these traditions and family recipes, they would be lost forever. How can she begin to create a recipe book if all her relatives were spread out across the world? That's when her wife did some research and recommended the app, “With Ingredients that Bind.” Alysha remembered that one of her coworkers briefly spoke about the app, only good things she remembered being said. She immediately downloaded the app, look at this template for recipes! She thought this was the perfect template to begin collecting recipes, it came with multiple, easily readable sections, “Recipe Title”, “Ingredients”, “Measurements”, “Kitchen Utensils”, “Steps”, and a section dedicated to adding photos, videos, or voice recordings. 

Alysha felt a wave of relief and inspiration. Relief, that now there was a way of digitally storing and sharing recipes with family despite the limitations of time and space. Inspiration, that now there was an easy template to follow in order to outline the ingredients and measurements. It wasn’t that measuring or tasting with “your heart” was an issue, it was so that anyone could use it as a metric to follow (or a suggestion) without horribly obscuring the proportions of the recipe. It was a great starting point for any possible iteration or additional changes to the recipe that may come due to personal or generational differences. The template helped organize her family’s recipes in a way that her children could understand and refer to in the future.
